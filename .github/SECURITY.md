## Security Policy
At Grams, we take security seriously and strive to provide a safe and secure platform for our users. This document outlines our security policy and describes how we handle security vulnerabilities.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy
We encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities you find in our platform or any of our repositories. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please contact us immediately at security@grams.com. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had sufficient time to address it.

When you report a vulnerability, please provide us with as much detail as possible, including:

* A detailed description of the vulnerability
* Any steps required to reproduce the vulnerability
* Any tools or scripts used to discover or exploit the vulnerability

We will make every effort to address the vulnerability in a timely manner and will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

We will credit you for your discovery in our security advisory and publicly acknowledge your contribution to our security efforts, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

### Bug Bounty Program
We do not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we appreciate any security vulnerabilities that are responsibly disclosed to us and will consider rewarding those who report vulnerabilities with swag, recognition, or other non-monetary incentives.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
